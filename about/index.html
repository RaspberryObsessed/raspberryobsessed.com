        <h1>About this site</h1>
        <br>
        <p>I made this website for a YouTube channel I previosly had, however I thought the channel was kinda 'cringe' 
            so I ended up deleting it.</p>
        <p>Recently I wanted to start a new YouTube channel, but sence I already owned this site I named the new 
        YouTube channel the same name.</p>
        <p>This site is really just to show new videos and plans for upcoming projects, it's also mainly for my custom 
           email address.</p>
        <p>Thanks for being here, and stay tuned for more updates!</p>
